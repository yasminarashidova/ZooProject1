    <h2>About Zebras</h2>
    <p> Zebras are amazing animals known for their black and white stripes, which make them easy to recognize! 
      Did you know that no two zebras have the same stripe pattern? Zebras live in Africa, where they roam grassy plains and stay together in herds to stay safe from predators like lions. 
      In our zoo, our lions and zebras are far away from each other and in separate enclosures. Zebras are fast runners because they need to be able to run to escape danger.
     When you visit our zoo, say hi to our zebras and try spotting what makes their stripes special!
