    <h2>About Lions</h2>
    <p> Lions are amazing big cats known as the "kings of the jungle," 
      even though they mostly live in grassy plains and savannas in Africa. They are famous for their loud roar, which can be heard from up to 5 miles away! 
      Male lions are easy to spot because of their thick, fluffy manes, while female lions, donâ€™t have manes and do most of the hunting. Lions live together in 
       prides, where they rest, play, and look after each other. They can sleep for up to 20 hours a day! Lions are strong, fast hunters and love to chase animals like zebras and antelopes. 
      Next time you see visit our zoo, come say hi to our lions maybe you'll hear them roar!
