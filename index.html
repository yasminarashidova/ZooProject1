    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> The African Safari Zoo is a unique zoo dedicated to its animals! Our enclosures are large and mimic a real African safari which allows our animals to 
      roam freely and comfortably. These enclosures also create an immersive experience for our visitors. We are confident that our zoo is a zoo unlike any
      other and the entire family will have a great time exploring all of our lovely animals! We also have a playground for younger kids and lots of restaraunts
      for when the family needs a break from all the fun.</p>
