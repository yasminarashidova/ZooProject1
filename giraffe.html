    <h2>About Giraffes</h2>
    <p> Giraffes are the tallest animals in the world, with long necks that help them reach leaves high up in trees! 
      Giraffes have unique spot patterns, kind of like human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same pattern!
      These gentle giants also have long, purple tongues that help them grab leaves without getting poked by thorns. 
      Giraffes spend most of their day eating and only need to sleep for about 30 minutes a day! 
      At the zoo, you might see giraffes walking gracefully or bending down in a funny way to take a sip of water. Theyâ€™re always curious and might come close to say hello!  </p>
