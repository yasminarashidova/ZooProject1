    <h2>About Hippos</h2>
    <p>Hippos, short for hippopotamuses, are big, strong animals that spend most of their time in rivers and lakes to stay cool under the hot sun. 
      Even though they look slow and sleepy, hippos can run surprisingly fast on land and swim well in the water!
      Although they seem calm, hippos are some of the most powerful animals in Africa, so our zookeepers always keep a safe distance. 
      Keep an eye out—maybe you’ll see one yawning wide or blowing bubbles in the water during when you visit our zoo! </p>
