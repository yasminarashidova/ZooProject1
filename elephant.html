    <h2>About Elephants</h2>
    <p> African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their impressive size and intelligence.
      We house savanna elephants who are usually found in sub-Saharan Africa
      and recognizable by their large ears, which help regulate body temperature, and their long trunks used for breathing, drinking, and grabbing objects.
      Unfortunately, they face threats like habitat loss and poaching for ivory, leading to a decline in their populations. Here at the African Safari zoo,
      we prioritze the health and happiness of our elephants and we hope you come to visit them during your next visit.  </p>
